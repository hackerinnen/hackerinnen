# A few words about you, who are you?

I am a Software Engineer from Baja California, Mexico. I used to be Adjunct Professor at the [University of Baja California](http://www.uabc.mx/).

I love working while having fun. I also love to learn new things, both personally and technically.

I like coaching and participating in workshops (e.g. [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/)) and conferences. I love reading, watching movies, taking long walks and enjoy having life talks over coffee (or a good glass of wine).

I am a teacher at heart. I like helping students be better prepared to land on their first real Software Engineering Job and help them acquire practice on the tools, technologies and processes that companies use - at least the ones I know about =).

# When and how did you get interested in coding?

I have been a book lover since I was little and I loved browsing through the bookshelf we had at my parent's house. A little before my first year of secondary school, I found there a [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) book that my father used for work and started looking through it. I found it very interesting and was curious to learn more, so I decided to enroll in the _Informatics_ option at my secondary school.

There I learned [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_programming_language) and [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_programming_language).

# What do you like about coding most?

I love that coding is like writing a book that is smart. Like in a good written book, I strive to structure code in a way that is readable to others and also engaging, code that is both an adventure and a delight to read.

# What is currently your favourite project?

I am currently having fun learning more about testing in Python and I am using a Django Girls [project](https://github.com/mignonnesaurus/my-first-blog) to practice.

# Is there a project you're particularly proud of?

I am proud to have built a [Loteria Espacial](https://github.com/mignonnesaurus/loteria-espacial) with my little sister for the NASA Space Apps [Challenge 2019](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/). She is new to programming and my JavaScript / React skills are not well developed, and I am proud of what we accomplished together. It was a great experience to both of us.

# What do you like to try/learn/know?

Keeping it simple and prioritizing the things that bring more value. I recently read [The Nature of Software Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23333088-the-nature-of-software-development) and I am working on applying more of the principles in this book into my work.

I also try learning different programming languages, specially those that will help me explore different ways of thinking and solving problems.

# What is your biggest challenge as a programmer?

On of my biggest challenges is admitting when I am tired and I need to stop, relax and take a break. This is particularly difficult when I am very interested and engaged into solving a problem.

# Do you have role models?

Yes: Trisha Gee, Simon Maple and Scott Hanselman.

# Can you recommend a book / podcast / tutorial / film or event?

[Django Girls](http://djangogirls.org) is great to learn programming in a fun and supportive environment and also to coach people who would like to learn programming surrounded by awesome people from the Python Community.

[The Hanselminutes podcast](https://www.hanselminutes.com/) is great. Very interesting conversations with people from the Tech Space and more.

[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) book is one of my favorites. Published 20 years ago and still relevant in many ways.
